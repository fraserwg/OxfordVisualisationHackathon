# OxfordVisualisationHackathon
The repository contains datasets for use in the PCS seminar series' data visualisation hackathon, along with some example code.

## Getting started
Two different datasets are provided for the hackathon, both of which can be found in the `data` directory. The first contains some data on the carbon footprint of EGU and the second is a collection of meteorological observations collected at the University of Reading. Example scripts of how to load the data are stored in the `src` directory.

A description of each dataset and some questions you may wish to explore are detailed below. You are, of course, welcome to take your analysis in any direction you wish.
